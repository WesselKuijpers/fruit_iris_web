                    This page contains all the information about the inner workings of Argos IRIS, as well as metrics
                    calculated on the model.
                    <br>
                    The data on this page is constantly updated with the latest metrics, because the model is constantly
                    adapting to new data.

            <h3>Accuracy and Loss</h3>
            <p>
                Below you will find the metrics for the accuracy and loss of the current model during the training
                process.
                <br>
                The lines labled 'training accuracy' and 'training loss' contain the metrict during the actual process
                with data that the model has 'seen' before.
                <br>
                The lines labled 'validation accuracy' and 'validation loss' show how the model preformed in predicting
                data that was never seen before.
                <br>
                Ideally, the validation line should closely follow the training line.

                        The accuracy of a model is usually determined after the model parameters are learned and fixed
                        and no learning is taking place. Then the test samples are fed to the model and the number of
                        mistakes (zero-one loss) the model makes are recorded, after comparison to the true targets.
                        Then the percentage of misclassification is calculated.
                        <br>
                        For example, if the number of test samples is 1000 and model classifies 952 of those correctly,
                        then the model's accuracy is 95.2%.

                        Loss value implies how well or poorly a certain model behaves after each iteration of
                        optimization. Ideally, one would expect the reduction of loss after each, or several,
                        iteration(s).
                        <br>
                        Loss is often used in the training process to find the "best" parameter values for your model
                        (e.g. weights in neural network). It is what you try to optimize in the training by updating
                        weights.
